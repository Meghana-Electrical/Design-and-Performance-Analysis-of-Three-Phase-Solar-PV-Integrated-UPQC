# Design-and-Performance-Analysis-of-Three-Phase-Solar-PV-Integrated-UPQC
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Unified Power Quality Conditioners (UPQC) in enhancing power quality within photovoltaic (PV) integrated systems operating in distribution networks. 

The growing emphasis on green energy and sustainable energy management has spurred the 
integration of distributed energy resources and distributed energy storage into distribution 
networks and micro grids. However, this surge in power electronic-based devices has led to 
a significant decline in power quality (PQ) within the distribution system. 

To address this issue, this article introduces a photovoltaic (PV) integrated unified power quality conditioner 
(UPQC) equipped with an adaptive compensating technique based on a variable leaky least 
mean square (VLLMS) algorithm. This soft computing- oriented method offers rapid 
convergence to the desired condition through an iterative approach while maintaining the 
weight of updating parameters within specified limits. Unlike conventional methods that rely 
on low pass or moving average filters, the VLLMS- based algorithm directly extracts 
fundamental components from polluted source voltage and load current to generate reference 
signals for the switching of shunt and series voltage source converters (VSCs) of the UPQC. 
By incorporating the feed-forward component of PV in the compensating technique of the 
shunt VSC, the system efficiently manages power balance between the grid, load, and PV, 
thereby resolving PQ issues such as current harmonics and poor power factor at the point of 
common coupling (PCC). 

Furthermore, it ensures the regulation of dc-link voltage. The 
series converter maintains a pure sinusoidal voltage at the load terminal regardless of 
sag/swell and harmonics present in the grid voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed 
system is validated through simulation implementation under various static and dynamic 
operating conditions.
